      <description>Overview The L3 of Computer Science Department of the ENS Lyon gathers each year at the ski station of &amp;ldquo;Les Sept Laux&amp;rdquo; for an entire week of ski and with conferences mornings and nights. I have been invited to present my works and interests in a 2-hours slot. Is attached the presentation given for this event. The first part of this presentation (in French) introduces statistical learning while the second one (in English) details the results of my PhD defensis.</description>

      <description>Overview The Engineer diploma of Biostatistics is the last year speciality which deals with the questions of biostatistics. That course is an introduction to the project over the 10X data set that students had to deal with. It implied data analysis and interpretations comparing different methods.</description>

      <description>Overview The DU BDSI 2019 is designed to fit with graduated and senior students who desire to keep on touch with forehead methods on big data and statistics for engineers.
Current Course  What are supervised and unsupervised methods ?
 What are PCA, tSNE and UMAP. How can they be interpretable, pros and cons ?
 What are the Lasso and the logistic regression, what is PLS and how those methods can be integrated in a single one ?</description>

      <description>Overview The PLS tool is powerfull to tackle the curse of dimensionality, especially if the dataset suffers form high colinearities or if $n&amp;lt;p$. It even works when the response matrix is multivariate!
That course, given to M2-biostatistics students of ISPED, website introduces that tool and its sparse version thanks to which this is easily possible to select variables.
Magistral course  Recalls over linear regression and non-invertible cases,
 PLS1 and PLS2 algorithms.</description>

      <description>Overview The Health and Science is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.
Current Course  Introduction to noisy and uncertain models.
 Recalls on function analysis, derivation rules and extrematlity conditions. Basis functions (exponential, logarithm, trigonometric).
 Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).

 Enumerations and Bayes formula
 Classical estimators (mean, variance)
 Usual discret and continuous laws.

      <title>Single-cell datasets visualizations : PCA Versus tSNE</title>

      <description>Overview The ISPED Summer School has been a perfect moment to talk about single-cell RNA-seq visualization and its importance in the current researches. Indeed, PCA tends to be set aside by methods such as tSNE because it gives deeper pieces of information on the given datasets. Serendipitously the conclusions over that tool must be manipulated with parsimony.
That course discusses most of the pros and cons of the two main visualization methods in immunoogy which are PCA and tSNE.</description>
