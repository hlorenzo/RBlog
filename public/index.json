We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulation of IP-10.","tags":[],"title":"Systems Vaccinology Identifies an Early Innate Immune Signature as a Correlate of Antibody Responses to the Ebola Vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Lorenzo","R Thiebaut","J Saracco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542582000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542582000,"objectID":"abb7cf7de3ff9ffd823a0c9f2bd5ae01","permalink":"/publication/jds_2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-19T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jds_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Several sets of variables can be analyzed simultaneously by canonical correlation in a multi-way analysis. These sets of variables are often high-dimensional and repeated over time. For instance, full-transcriptome measured by RNA-Seq used to be performed in longitudinal studies as well as other measures such as peptides or cells. Hence, canonical correlation analysis has been extended with regularized approaches to deal with several high dimensional data. However, some measurements can be missing for technical reasons and therefore introduce undesired structures due to the huge dimension of the datasets. Our objective is to find an efficient method allowing to impute the missing values taking into account the three-way structure, participant-transcriptome-time, and also the missing path structure. We proposed an EM-like covariance-maximization lasso-penalized high-dimensional completion matrix algorithm to reach that goal. We compared our approach on simulated data-sets with the mean imputation per gene pertime step, the missMDA-imputeMFA algorithm which takes structure into account and the softImpute solution initially designed to solve the Netix competition a high-dimensional problem. We used two criterions: the L2-error between estimated and simulated values and the L2-error between estimated and simulated covariance matrices. The numerical results exhibited the superiority of the proposed method in most of the scenarii. We also illustrated our approach on a real data-set from a phase I Ebola vaccine trial measuring RNA-Seq data after vaccination (richtien, cell report 2017) in 20 participants at 4 different times on whole-blood samples, representing 74 sequenced-samples, among which 24 samples were missing because of technological issues.","tags":[],"title":"Une PLS multivoie parcimonieuse avec observations manquantes pour données hétérogènes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview The Health and Science is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.\nCurrent Course  Introduction to noisy and uncertain models.\n Recalls on function analysis, derivation rules and extrematlity conditions.
