The response outcome can be multidimensional and constitutes the response block. Multiblock covariate data sets are constituted by heterogeneous types of data (e.g. generated by various bioassays) and/or temporal realisations of the same covariates. The ddsPLS approach only deals with a specific case of missing values, denoted as missing samples, which means that some individuals have missing values for all the covariates in a given block. The ddsPLS method performs imputation of missing data, covariate selection and prediction of the response. The method is based on singular value decompositions of soft-thresholded covariance blocks via a three-steps procedure. The tuning parameters of the ddsPLS method can be optimized through an available cross-validation procedure. The ddsPLS package is illustrated on a real data set.","tags":[],"title":"ddsPLS: A Package to Deal with Multiblock Supervised Problems with Missing Samples in High Dimension","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview The Engineer diploma of Biostatistics is the last year speciality which deals with the questions of biostatistics.

We compared our approach on simulated data-sets with the mean imputation per gene per time step, the missMDA-imputeMFA algorithm which takes structure into account and the softImpute  solution  initially  designed  to  solve  the  Netflix  competition  a  high-dimensional problem.  We used two criterions:  the L2-error between estimated and simulated values and the L2-error between estimated and simulated covariance matrices.  The numerical results exhibited the superiority of the proposed method in most of the scenarii.  We also illustrated our approach on a real data-set from a phase I Ebola vaccine trial measuring RNA-Seq data after vaccination (richtien, cell report 2017) in 20 participants at 4 different times on whole blood  samples,  representing 74  sequenced-samples,  among which  24  samples were missing because of technological issues.","tags":[],"title":"Multiway high-dimensional lasso-penalized analysis with imputation of missing data applied to postgenomic data in an Ebola vaccine trial","type":"talk"},{"authors":["A Rechtien","L Richert","H Lorenzo","G Martrus","B Hejblum","C Dahlke","R Kasonta","M Zinser","H Stubbe","U Matschl","A Lohse","V Krähling","M Eickmann","S Becker","VEBCON Consortium","R Thiebaut","M Altfeld","M Addo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503957600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503957600,"objectID":"cd871071b994ee387a3afd8200ea43a5","permalink":"/publication/ebola_cell/","publishdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ebola_cell/","section":"publication","summary":"Predicting vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulation of IP-10.","tags":[],"title":"Systems Vaccinology Identifies an Early Innate Immune Signature as a Correlate of Antibody Responses to the Ebola Vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview The ISPED Summer School has been a perfect moment to talk about single-cell RNA-seq visualization and its importance in the current researches.

A direct correlation was observed for CD4 count and viral load associated to IP-10 and VCAM-1. Association to virus replicative capacity (vRC) was non-linear  for 6 distinct cytokines and subsequent analysis revealed that this relationship was being driven by a small subset of volunteers. Further characterization of these volunteers is ongoing.","tags":[],"title":"Viral Replicative Capacity Displays a Non-Linear Association to Cytokine Profiles Observed in Acutely Infected Volunteers in Contrast to Viral Load and CD4 T-cell Counts","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne\r Two\r Three\r\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
