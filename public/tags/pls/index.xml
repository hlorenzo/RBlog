      <description>Overview The PLS tool is powerfull to tackle the curse of dimensionality, especially if the dataset suffers form high colinearities or if $n&amp;lt;p$. It even works when the response matrix is multivariate!
That course, given to M2-biostatistics students of ISPED, website introduces that tool and its sparse version thanks to which this is easily possible to select variables.
Magistral course  Recalls over linear regression and non-invertible cases,
 PLS1 and PLS2 algorithms.</description>
