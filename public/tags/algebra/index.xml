      <description>Overview The Health and Science is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.
Course  Physical problem example: two weights bound with a spring. System of two bounded ordinary differntial equations (EDO). Solution with no linear algebra general theory.
 Linear algebra discovering: vectors, matrices, basis operations: sum, product, trace, determinant, inverse. Notions of free family.</description>
