      <description>Overview The DU BDSI 2019 is designed to fit with graduated and senior students who desire to keep on touch with forehead methods on big data and statistics for engineers.
Current Course  What are supervised and unsupervised methods ?
 What are PCA, tSNE and UMAP. How can they be interpretable, pros and cons ?
 What are the Lasso and the logistic regression, what is PLS and how those methods can be integrated in a single one ?</description>

      <description>Overview The PLS tool is powerfull to tackle the curse of dimensionality, especially if the dataset suffers form high colinearities or if $n&amp;lt;p$. It even works when the response matrix is multivariate!
That course, given to M2-biostatistics students of ISPED, website introduces that tool and its sparse version thanks to which this is easily possible to select variables.
Magistral course  Recalls over linear regression and non-invertible cases,
 PLS1 and PLS2 algorithms.</description>
