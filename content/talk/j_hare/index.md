# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) V-PLEX 40 biomarker cytokine multiplex kit, the cytokine profiles of 108 HIV+ Zambian volunteers were investigated for their associations to virus replicative capacity, CD4 count and viral load. A direct correlation was observed for CD4 count and viral load associated to IP-10 and VCAM-1. Association to virus replicative capacity (vRC) was non-linear  for 6 distinct cytokines and subsequent analysis revealed that this relationship was being driven by a small subset of volunteers. Further characterization of these volunteers is ongoing."
