# Biography
Hadrien Lorenzo is a PhD student in the [SISTM team](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/en/teams/statistics-in-systems-biology-and-translationnal-medicine-sistm/). He mainly works on analysing high dimensional datasets (*just a few individuals and thousands of variables*) with longitudinal structures. **SVD**-based methods are what he loves the most and he currently works on dealing with **missing values** in supervised context.

**SISTM** is mainly devoted to vaccine research and clinical trial data analyses in the context of largely scaled datasets. This is on of the few [INSERM](https://www.inserm.fr/en)/[INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux) teams.
