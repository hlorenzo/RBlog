# Course:

   - Physical problem example: two weights bound with a spring. System of two bounded ordinary differntial equations (**EDO**). Solution with no linear algebra general theory.
   
   - Linear algebra discovering: vectors, matrices, basis operations: sum, product, trace, determinant, inverse. Notions of *free family*. Diagonalisation.

   - Two applied examples: 

    - Square inverse problem (as much equations as variables): solution with matrix inversion.
    - Solve a system of coupled linear **EDO** thanks to diagonalisation.

# Practical work, Python:

  - General formalism over Python for vectors and matrices. 
  - How can we do the *loops* ?
  
  - Square linear problem resolution.
  
  - Eigen-space decomposition.
  
  - Numerical solution of the problem: two weights bound with a spring.
